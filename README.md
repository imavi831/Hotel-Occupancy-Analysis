The dashboard is a dynamic mixture of slicers and charts, providing an insightful overview of a prominent hotel chain's performance, primarily operating in Europe during the years 2015, 2016, and 2017. This well-structured dashboard is designed to offer a comprehensive understanding of crucial hotel metrics and trends, enhancing decision-making and strategic planning.

**Left-Side Metrics and Slicers:**

On the left-hand side of the dashboard, users are presented with key performance metrics, including the total number of customers, booking amounts, and the total number of cancellations. These metrics serve as fundamental indicators of the hotel chain's operational health. 

To make the analysis more granular and actionable, there is a slicer provided, allowing users to select specific months of interest. This interactive feature enables users to drill down into monthly data, identifying patterns, and evaluating performance on a month-to-month basis. 

**Right-Side Slicers and Key Visualizations:**

The right-hand side of the dashboard is dedicated to a set of slicers that provide users with the ability to filter data based on several essential parameters:

- **Year Selection:** Users can choose between the years 2015, 2016, and 2017 to view data for a particular year or compare multiple years to identify trends and changes over time.

- **Hotel Type:** This slicer allows users to filter data by the type of hotel, such as luxury, mid-range, or budget hotels. This segmentation is valuable for understanding the performance of different hotel segments within the chain.

- **Agents' Impact:** Users can also filter data by the agents who brought in customers. This insight is particularly valuable for assessing the effectiveness of various agents and partnerships.

**Key Visualizations:**

Complementing the slicers are a set of key visualizations that provide a deeper understanding of the hotel chain's performance:

- **Line Charts:** Line charts illustrate trends over time, allowing users to track changes in metrics like total customers, booking amounts, and cancellations across different months or years. These charts facilitate trend analysis and forecasting.

- **Bar Charts:** Bar charts provide comparisons across different hotel types, making it easy to see how each segment contributes to overall performance. Users can quickly identify which types of hotels are thriving and which may need attention.

This interactive and intuitive dashboard empowers stakeholders to explore the hotel chain's data effortlessly. Whether it's analyzing year-over-year growth, understanding the impact of different hotel types, or evaluating agent performance, this dashboard serves as a powerful tool for data-driven decision-making within the hotel industry.

# Evaluation Criteria
We evaluated our dashboard based on the following criteria:

1. Use of interactive filters and slicers to allow users to customize the data being displayed.
2. Use of clear and concise data labels to provide additional context for data points.
3. Proper alignment and spacing of visualizations.
4. Appropriate font size and color scheme.
5. Clear and concise titles for visualizations, reports, and dashboards.
6. Use of appropriate background color to improve the visibility of visualizations.

# Key Insights

1. july has the highest number of customer occupency and city hotels have twice as much occupency compared to resort hotels

2. Direct segments have lower rate of cancellation.

3. Online Tour operators bring us highest number of bookings 1342 whereas aviatoion sector agents brought us least booking 

4. The revenue generated during weekneds and weekdays are mostly equal but slightly differences between them.

5. Repeated guests do not cancel their bookings it might happen they serve best to their guests and mostly are of some special type of guests also most of the customers are not repeated guests.

6. From the data set we concluded that highest number of bookings are from Portugal may be hotel  is located at Portugal itself and second country is the gbr which means united kingdom which is roughly approximated below 75% of Portugal bookings.

7. The prices of resort hotels are much higher during the month of august.The price of the city hotels varies less and is most expensive during may and September.

8. The total number of guest that visited hotel is 5878 of which   5586 were adults  263 children and  29 babies

9. City hotels has more guests throughout  the year. Resort hotels are slightly closer to city hotels in summer season when by comparing their proportions. From June to September, when costs are at their greatest, few guests stay at the Resort hotel.when  winter season comes the few visitors to both the hotels.

10. As I can see from data set customers from aviation segment do not seem to be staying at the resort hotels and have a relatively lower average daily rate.

# Recommendations
1. This clearly shows that the prices in the Resort hotel are much higher during the month of August. 

2. There is summer season there in Portugal at that time. The price of the city hotel varies less and is most expensive during may and September where there is spring and autumn season respectively.

3. Cancellation rate in the direct segment is so  low.

4. most people does not preferred to stay at the hotels more than one week. but it seems normally to stay in resort hotels almost 2 weeks may be this changes according to segments.

Certainly, if the project was based solely on Excel, the challenges and problems faced during its development would be specific to Excel and data analysis within the Excel environment. Here's a revised response to address this:

# Problem Faced

1. **Data Quality and Cleanup:** Dealing with missing or incomplete data in the Excel spreadsheet required careful handling. Decisions had to be made regarding whether to impute missing values or exclude incomplete records.
   
2. **Data Integration:**  data was sourced from multiple Excel files or worksheets, integrating and structuring the data consistently within Excel posed a challenge. Data from different years or sources required manual reconciliation.

3. **Data Exploration:** Understanding the dataset and identifying relevant features for analysis required extensive data exploration within Excel. This phase was time-consuming as it involved gaining domain-specific knowledge about the hotel industry using Excel's capabilities.

4. **Visualization in Excel:** Designing informative and visually appealing charts and tables within Excel that effectively communicated the project's findings to stakeholders was a creative challenge. Choosing the right chart types and formatting options in Excel to convey insights accurately was crucial.
