# Evaluation Criteria
We evaluated our dashboard based on the following criteria:

1. Use of interactive filters and slicers to allow users to customize the data being displayed.
2. Use of clear and concise data labels to provide additional context for data points.
3. Proper alignment and spacing of visualizations.
4. Appropriate font size and color scheme.
5. Clear and concise titles for visualizations, reports, and dashboards.
6. Use of appropriate background color to improve the visibility of visualizations.

# Key Insights

1. july has the highest number of customer occupency and city hotels have twice as much occupency compared to resort hotels

2. Direct segments have lower rate of cancellation.

3. Online Tour operators bring us highest number of bookings 1342 whereas aviatoion sector agents brought us least booking 

4. The revenue generated during weekneds and weekdays are mostly equal but slightly differences between them.

5. Repeated guests do not cancel their bookings it might happen they serve best to their guests and mostly are of some special type of guests also most of the customers are not repeated guests.

6. From the data set we concluded that highest number of bookings are from Portugal may be hotel  is located at Portugal itself and second country is the gbr which means united kingdom which is roughly approximated below 75% of Portugal bookings.

7. The prices of resort hotels are much higher during the month of august.The price of the city hotels varies less and is most expensive during may and September.

8. The total number of guest that visited hotel is 5878 of which   5586 were adults  263 children and  29 babies

9. City hotels has more guests throughout  the year. Resort hotels are slightly closer to city hotels in summer season when by comparing their proportions. From June to September, when costs are at their greatest, few guests stay at the Resort hotel.when  winter season comes the few visitors to both the hotels.

10. As I can see from data set customers from aviation segment do not seem to be staying at the resort hotels and have a relatively lower average daily rate.

# Recommendations
1. This clearly shows that the prices in the Resort hotel are much higher during the month of August. 

2. There is summer season there in Portugal at that time. The price of the city hotel varies less and is most expensive during may and September where there is spring and autumn season respectively.

3. Cancellation rate in the direct segment is so  low.

4. most people does not preferred to stay at the hotels more than one week. but it seems normally to stay in resort hotels almost 2 weeks may be this changes according to segments.
